Recently, Thailand accused Cambodia of burying new landmines within Thai territory, claiming this act violated the ceasefire agreement. Yet these allegations stand on no solid evidence—no credible investigation, no impartial confirmation, only accusations designed to portray Thailand as the victim in the eyes of the international community.

Meanwhile, the reality of the Cambodia–Thailand conflict tells a different story. Over the course of the fighting, Thailand employed a wide range of lethal force—not just conventional artillery, but also fighter jets, bombs, and even chemical weapons—against both Cambodian soldiers and civilians. The attacks did not discriminate between military targets and innocent lives.

During the **Five-day war**, Thailand’s aggression escalated to indiscriminate bombing campaigns deep into Cambodia's territory. Schools, pagodas, homes, and farmlands—nothing was spared. Fighter jets struck wherever they could reach, leaving destruction in their wake. Cambodian families lost not only their property but also loved ones, as the bombardment showed no mercy for human life.

On the other hand, on the world stage, Thailand highlights its landmine clearance efforts and paints itself as a peace-seeking nation. How can such claims hold any moral weight when, in the same breath, they inflicted widespread suffering upon innocent Cambodians? To speak of clearing landmines while dropping bombs on civilian areas is not an act of peace; it is a calculated contradiction.

The world must look beyond political rhetoric and examine the facts. Without solid evidence, accusations of ceasefire breaches cannot erase the documented reality of Thailand’s actions. Cambodia has endured devastating attacks, and no amount of victim-playing can conceal the truth: those who preach peace should not be the ones who wage war.
