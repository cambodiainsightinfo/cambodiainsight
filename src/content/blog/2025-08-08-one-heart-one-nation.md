The recent conflict between Thailand and Cambodia has not only tested our borders but also the strength of our national spirit. In moments of chaos, the Cambodian people are reminded that the preservation of our independence, dignity, and sovereignty is not guaranteed—it is earned through sacrifice, unity, and unwavering patriotism.

When the shadow of conflict looms, it becomes clear that our fate as a nation rests not in the hands of foreign powers but in our determination to stand as one. History has taught us that division invites domination, while unity forges strength. The **Angkor Empire**, built by the sweat, skill, and sacrifice of our ancestors, stands as a timeless example of what can be achieved when the Khmer people work together with one heart and one purpose.

Today, the lesson is unmistakable: patriotism is not just a feeling, it is a duty. We must rise above political differences, regional divides, and personal interests to prioritize the survival of our motherland. The enemy does not see us as individuals from different provinces or backgrounds; they see us simply as Cambodians, Khmer. If they are united in their intent, then we must be even more united in our defense.

To be patriotic is not merely to wave a flag or sing the **National Anthem**. It is to live each day with the conscious commitment to protect our land, preserve our culture, and honor the sacrifices of those who came before us. It is to refuse to live as slaves under the enemy’s control, to reject humiliation, and to fight—whether on the battlefield, in the marketplace, or in the face of injustice—for the dignity of Cambodia.

We, the Cambodian people, are stronger than we realize. We must awaken the spirit that once made our Khmer Empire a beacon of Southeast Asia. Let us channel the courage of our ancestors, who built wonders from stone and carved our name into history. Millions of Khmer hearts must beat as one, united in love for our land and people.

The recent conflict is a warning and a wake-up call: only through patriotism can we escape the grip of any enemy. Let us rise, strive, and unite. Let us honor our ancestors not only with words, but with action—building schools, advancing our economy, safeguarding our borders, and nurturing the next generation. Just as stone by stone, Angkor rose from the earth, so will our nation rise again through our shared determination.

The future of Cambodia is not in the hands of fate—it is in our hands as the sons and daughters of Cambodia. Rise, Unite, and Protect Our Motherland!
