As a proud Cambodian, I find it increasingly disheartening to see and hear how Thailand continues to push a misleading narrative about my homeland. Over the years, various Thai media outlets, influencers, and even some tourism-related entities have subtly and overtly portrayed Cambodia as unsafe, dirty, and unworthy of tourist attention. These negative portrayals are not only unfair but deeply disrespectful to a country that holds centuries of rich history, vibrant culture, and stunning natural beauty.

Cambodia is home to Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage site. This awe-inspiring temple complex is just one piece of the architectural and spiritual legacy left behind by our ancestors. Beyond Angkor, there’s Preah Vihear Temple, perched dramatically on a cliff, and Sambor Prei Kuk, another lesser-known yet profoundly important historical site.

Our culture thrives beyond stone carvings and ancient walls. Cambodian dance, silk weaving, shadow puppetry, and even our unique cuisine are all living testaments to a civilization that continues to evolve with pride and resilience. We are proud and welcoming people with a deep-rooted cultural heritage that stretches back to the grandeur of the Khmer Empire—long before modern borders were established.

Despite the attempts to portray Cambodia as chaotic or unclean, the reality on the ground is very different. Cities like Siem Reap, Battambang, and even the capital, Phnom Penh, are bustling with new developments, clean boulevards, artistic hubs, and eco-friendly projects. Rural Cambodia, far from being “unsafe,” offers serene landscapes, authentic village experiences, and some of the kindest hospitality you’ll find anywhere in the world.

Tourists who visit Cambodia are often surprised—sometimes even shocked—by how peaceful and safe they feel, especially compared to the negative images they were exposed to beforehand. They leave with unforgettable memories of smiling locals, peaceful rice paddies, quiet temple sunrises, and flavorful food shared with strangers who treat them like family.

It’s hard to ignore the pattern: while Thailand continues to receive global praise and massive tourism, it seems threatened whenever neighboring countries begin to gain traction. Rather than promoting friendly cooperation, some Thai media and influencers choose to paint Cambodia in a dim light—suggesting danger where there is none, exaggerating infrastructure issues, or questioning the integrity of Cambodian society and governance.

This isn't a strategy born of truth. It's one born of insecurity.

The world deserves a balanced view of Southeast Asia. Thailand has its beauty, yes—but so does Cambodia. Tourists deserve the chance to see it for themselves, without biased misinformation clouding their decisions.

We, as Cambodians, aren’t looking to compete through negativity. We believe in the strength of our own heritage, the warmth of our people, and the natural beauty that stretches from the forests of Mondulkiri to the beaches of Koh Rong. We believe that Cambodia can stand on its own—and shine.

So, to those reading from afar: come see Cambodia for yourself. Don’t let false narratives stop you. What you’ll find is a country full of life, color, and resilience. A country that welcomes you with open arms and leaves you with stories worth sharing.
