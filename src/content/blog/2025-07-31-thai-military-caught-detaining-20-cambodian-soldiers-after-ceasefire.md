# **Thai Military Caught Detaining 20 Cambodian Soldiers After Ceasefire**

Despite a ceasefire taking effect at midnight on July 29, the Thai military has admitted to capturing 20 Cambodian soldiers who approached in peace.

🔴 This is a direct violation of the agreement and a betrayal of trust.

📅 July 30, 2025 – 16:12

In a shocking and deeply painful development, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have reported to foreign military attachés and diplomats from 13 countries that 20 Cambodian soldiers were abducted by Thai forces after the ceasefire officially took effect at midnight on July 29.

According to Cambodian military sources, a group of our soldiers stepped forward in peace unarmed, open-handed, and trusting to meet Thai troops who had already crossed into Cambodian territory. But instead of peace, they were met with betrayal. On our own soil, under the flag of a ceasefire, Thai forces turned their weapons on our men and dragged them away. It was not only an attack on our soldiers it was an assault on our national dignity, a brutal violation of our land, and a wound to the soul of Cambodia.

‼️What’s even more disturbing: The Thai military has now admitted to capturing the Cambodian soldiers, confirming this was not a battlefield incident but a targeted operation in violation of the truce.

Of the 20 captured, one hero managed to escape, while two are feared dead. The fate of the remaining 17 remains uncertain, and no concrete steps have been taken by the Thai side to secure their release or provide clarity.

Thailand’s actions stand in direct contradiction to the peace efforts led by President Donald J. Trump, who has worked tirelessly to de-escalate tensions and promote stability in the region.

👉 Cambodia mourns not only the broken trust but also the cruel loss of peace so soon after it was promised.
