# **Thai Soldiers Capture 20 Cambodian Troops in Shocking Ambush**

**Preah Vihear Provinc**e- Just hours after a ceasefire agreement was approved, Thai soldiers violated the deal and launched a violent ambush on Cambodian troops, capturing 20 soldiers and reportedly killing several. The incident occurred at approximately 5:17 AM on July 29, 2025, in the Sam Tae area of Thailand’s Si Sa Ket province.

According to initial reports, the Cambodian soldiers had gathered peacefully near the border area, following the ceasefire terms agreed by both nations. **Cambodian military commander Chan Sopheaktra** stated that the soldiers were even posing for a photo with Thai troops as a symbolic gesture of peace. However, in a shocking turn of events, Thai forces allegedly opened fire and moved in with tanks and 15–20 armed soldiers to attack the Cambodian side.

> “One of our soldiers managed to escape and reported that after the photo, more Thai soldiers appeared from behind and began capturing our men,” said Commander Chan. “They smiled, but what followed was violence.”  

Despite being under attack, Cambodian troops were ordered not to fight back, as instructed by high command. “We followed orders. We did not return fire. We only took cover and tried to avoid further casualties,” Chan added.

Eyewitness accounts from a surviving soldier describe the horror of seeing teammates being killed, beaten, and taken away—some reportedly killed on the spot during the ambush.

”Do you feel hurt when Thailand used the lowest of tricks to capture Khmer soldiers, while we were being most honest with them,” aid Chan Sopheaktra, with a painful voice. 

A high-ranking Cambodian military official is now reportedly working in close coordination with the Malaysian army chief to negotiate the safe return of the captured soldiers.

This incident marks a serious escalation in the already tense border situation between Cambodia and Thailand, particularly around the contested Preah Vihear region. Cambodian citizens and officials alike are expressing deep outrage and heartbreak over the loss and betrayal.
