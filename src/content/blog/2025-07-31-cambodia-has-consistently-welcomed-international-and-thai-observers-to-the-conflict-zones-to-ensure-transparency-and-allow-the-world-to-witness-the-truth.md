# Cambodia has consistently welcomed international and Thai observers to the conflict zones to ensure transparency and allow the world to witness the truth.

On behalf of Cambodian senators and the Cambodian people, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Shauna King, the founder of IMR, and all IMR team members for their tireless efforts. Cambodia is fortunate to be among the 90 countries where IMR provides free and effective medical services.

I have two suggestions for IMR: 

*   First, consider focusing your next Cambodia mission on vulnerable communities in the Cambodian-Thai border provinces.
    
*   Second, aim to reach your 1,000,000th patient in the province where the Preah Vihear Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located. 
    

I hope these goals are not a "mission impossible" for the IMR team.

> My deepest thanks go to President Donald Trump for his effective and timely actions, which resulted in a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand. I also extend gratitude to the leaders and people of Malaysia and China for their efforts in ensuring a ceasefire, promoting peaceful resolutions, and upholding international law. Cambodia has consistently welcomed international and Thai observers to the conflict zones to ensure transparency and allow the world to witness the truth.

Last but not least, I wish you all a safe and enjoyable journey back to Colorado, a beautiful and peaceful place I dream of visiting in the future.

With sincere thanks,
