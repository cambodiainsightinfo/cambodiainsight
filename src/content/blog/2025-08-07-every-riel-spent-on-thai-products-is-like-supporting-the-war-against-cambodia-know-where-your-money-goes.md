## **Every Riel Spent on Thai Products is Like Supporting the War Against Cambodia. KNOW WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES!**

![](/news/every-riel-spend-on-thai-product.jpg)

As a fellow **Cambodian**, it is heartbreaking to witness the ongoing conflict between our country and Thailand. While our soldiers defend our land, and innocent civilians suffer from bombings and destruction, something is happening quietly that we all need to think about: our daily spending.

Many of us still use and support Thai brands, including fuel, snacks, coffee, cosmetics, construction materials, and more. But have we ever stopped and asked ourselves: where does the money go?

The truth is, many Thai businesses are closely tied to the Thai government and military. When we purchase Thai products, part of that money flows back into their economy—and some of it ends up supporting the very army that is attacking our land, destroying our temples, and hurting our people. That means continuing to support Thai brands is like giving a hand and funding the war against our nation.

This conflict has already caused us deep wounds. Our cultural heritage sites, like Preah Vihear Temple, have been bombed. Homes have been burned. Families have been displaced. And our brave soldiers—some captured, some injured, some lost their precious lives—are paying the highest price to protect us and our nation. So why should we, at the same time, help fuel Thailand’s economy?

We, the Cambodian people, have more power than we realize. Every product we choose, every riel we spend, sends a message. If we truly care about our nation, our people, and our future, we must start changing the way we spend. Supporting Cambodian products, or goods from friendly nations, is not only good for our economy—it is also a quiet, but peaceful way to stand up for Cambodia.

This is not about hatred or resentment. It is about survival. It is about protecting our sovereignty. It is about refusing to give our hard-earned money to a country that is causing us pain and suffering.

Let’s stop feeding the war, support peace and stand with Cambodia—together. Let us unite—not only in protest or on the battlefield—but in our markets, our homes, and our daily choices.

Let every purchase become an act of patriotism, and every refusal to buy Thai products, a step toward peace. Together, we can protect our nation—not just with words, but with the power of our choices!
